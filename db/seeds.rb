  summary: "Stan Sitwell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is a real estate tycoon who runs the company Sitwell Enterprises, which competes with the Bluth Company.\n\nHe has a disease that prevents him from growing hair on his body, alopecia universalis. Lucille incorrectly refers to him as an alpaca. Stan Sitwell begins dating Lucille Austero. His outlandish wigs and fake facial hair are a bit of an inside joke, since in real life Ed Begley Jr. is known for his mane of thick blonde hair. Because of his condition he can't actually drive the Corvette that Michael Bluth gave him in return of making a bid on his daughter Sally Sitwell at the Country Club auction because it is a convertible, which causes him to lose his wig and fake eyebrows. When Stan Sitwell fires Gob Bluth from his company, Gob gets revenge on Sitwell by stealing his fake dressy eyebrows. He runs his business in a very straight forward, professional manner in contrast to the lying and manipulation of the Bluths. He is also a generous philanthropist and contributes to numerous charities, contrary to the Bluths as well.",

  body: "Michael Bluth and family gather to discuss George Sr.'s upcoming trial. They've received a plea offer, but lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn hasn't read it yet. Lucille, speaking for George Sr., wants to accept the plea. Cindi Lightballoon, an undercover FBI agent, watched George Sr.'s \"Caged Wisdom\" series of self-help videos and fell in love with him. She tells George Sr. that she knows for a fact that he can beat the government's case against him. Michael takes the plea documents to a nearby bar to read.\n\n
Meanwhile, Lindsay receives a letter from Maeby's school saying that her daughter is failing. Lindsay and Tobias hire George Michael to tutor Maeby. Later, Maeby shows George Michael a recent (failed) test and pays him to fill in the correct answers.\n\n
Michael sits down to read the plea, but Gob suggests he have a one-night stand with a lawyer instead. As Michael reads the plea, a woman, Maggie Lizer, bumps into him. Michael introduces himself as \"Chareth Cutestory,\" maritime lawyer; he goes home with Maggie. The following morning, Maggie appears with coffee and he suddenly realizes that she is blind."

And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&mdash;most seen here at the Equator&mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\n\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven.\n\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.\n\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&mdash;forbidding&mdash;now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.\n\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there."
